Logical and Physical Mode Exploration - Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates the difference between Logical Mode and Physical Mode in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It includes connecting devices with different cables, installing a backup router, and configuring device hostnames to better understand both network topology and real-world physical layout.

• Objectives

- Investigate devices in a wiring closet  
- Connect end devices to networking devices  
- Install a backup router  
- Configure a hostname on a router  
- Understand the difference between **Logical** and **Physical** modes in Cisco Packet Tracer

• Summary of Work

1. Investigated devices in a wiring closet  
   - Explored how networking devices are organized in a rack, table, and shelf setup.  
   - Observed the role and placement of physical components such as switches, routers, and PCs.  

2. Connected end devices to networking devices  
   - Used various cables including **Ethernet**, **console**, and **USB console cables** to establish connections between end devices and network devices.  

3. Installed a backup router 
   - Deployed an additional router for redundancy and verified device interconnections.  

4. Configured a hostname 
   - Assigned a hostname to the router to help identify the device within the network topology.
